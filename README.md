# NFL-Arrests
- An analysis of a dataset based on when NFL players have been arrested and under what circumstances
- View project here(knitted rendered HTML file): https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Seth22/NFL-Arrests/blob/main/NFLArrests.html

## Future Plans
1. Further optimizing data analysis

   - Such as a weighted graph of NFL players arrested in each position based on how common that population is to an NFL team(currently positions that are more common on a team such as a linebacker will have more arrests than quarterback since they are more common) 

3. Making graphics more visually appealing
   - Use colors to help tell the story of the data more effectively
   - Make graphs more aesthetic(eye-catching easier to focus on)
